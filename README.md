## University of California, Riverside | CS10 Series
CS10 is a course series offered by UCR dedicated to the foundations of C++ and introductory to Data Structures and Algorithms.

### CS10A
Course Description: Covers problem solving through structured programming of algorithms on computers using the C++ object-oriented language. Includes variables, expressions, input/output (I/O), branches, loops, functions, parameters, strings.

### CS10B
Course Description: Covers structured and object-oriented programming in C++. Emphasizes good programming principles and development of substantial programs. Topics include file input/output (I,O), classes, arrays, pointers, linked lists, abstract data types, recursion, and libraries.

### CS10C
Course Description: Covers basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and queues. Covers dictionaries (including binary search trees and hashing) and priority queues (heaps). Offers an introductory analysis of algorithms, sorting algorithms, and object-oriented programming, including abstract data types, inheritance, and polymorphism.
